## Three-Page Website Summary

This project consists of a three-page website with the following pages: Home, Contact, and Task.

### Home Page
The Home Page displays a simple welcome message and a clear button. Clicking the clear button prompts the user with an alert message asking if they want to clear the stored data.

### Contact Page
The Contact Page includes a form with fields for the user to enter their First Name, Last Name, Email ID, and Phone Number. Upon successful submission of the form, the data is saved in the local storage. The stored First Name and Last Name are displayed on the Home Page. The form has proper validations to ensure that the required fields are filled out correctly before submission.

### Task Page
The Task Page provides functionality for creating a to-do list. The tasks are temporarily stored in an array and can be deleted or updated. The user can add tasks, mark them as completed, edit task details, and remove tasks from the list.

The website utilizes local storage to store contact information and task data, providing a persistent experience for the user across sessions.

The Clear button on the Home Page allows the user to clear the stored data. However, before clearing, an alert message appears, asking the user to confirm if they want to proceed with clearing the data.

This three-page website provides a simple and user-friendly interface for managing tasks and storing contact information, enhancing productivity and organization.
